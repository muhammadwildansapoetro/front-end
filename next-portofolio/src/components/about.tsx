            Hi! I'm Muhammad Wildan Sapoetro, a passionate web developer with a
            love for creating clean, user-friendly websites. I started my
            journey in web development to bring ideas to life on the web, and
            I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies to improve my
            skills.

          <br />
          <p className="text-xl">
            I specialize in front-end development and am proficient in HTML,
            CSS, JavaScript, and React. I'm currently working with Next.js to
            build responsive and interactive web experiences.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="text-xl">
            As a lifelong learner, I’m always on the lookout for new ways to
            expand my skillset. From online courses to personal projects, every
            experience has helped me grow as a developer.
          </p>

          <br />
          <p className="text-xl">
            I’m excited to continue building my skills and look forward to
            tackling new challenges in web development. My next goal is to dive
            deeper into backend development and expand my knowledge of
            full-stack technologies.
